## HOTOSM-Street-Level Imagery Analysis

This repository contains tools used to conduct classification and segmentation of street level images collected in Kenya using Mappillary. This will help to take data driven decisions for humanitarial activities during catastrophical events.

1. Automatic data collection of street level images from Mappillary website.
2. Image annotations using Labelbox and conversion of the annotatios to masks for segmentation tasks.
3. Modelling goals achieved:
    1. Developed a lightweight MobileNet model to classify street level images into paved and unpaved.
    2. Developed UNet based Segmentation model to segment the roads and building materials.
